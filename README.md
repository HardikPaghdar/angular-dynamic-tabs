# Angular 14 Dynamic Tabs Using Material UI

This is a test project to dynamic add remove tabs using Angular 14. 

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HardikPaghdar/angular-dynamic-tabs
cd angular-dynamic-tabs
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
ng serve
```

The `ng serve` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
